## Problem

Many users shop with specific items in mind, often overlooking bundle offers that provide discounts and package deals. This behavior can lead to missed savings for customers and reduced profits for companies.

## Solution

**BundleUp** is a lightweight application that analyzes purchase data from an Excel file to automatically generate product bundles. These bundles are designed to maximize savings for users while increasing sales and profits for businesses. The app suggests optimal package deals based on user preferences and buying patterns, making shopping more efficient and rewarding for both customers and companies.

## How to Run

To start the main app locally, navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
streamlit run BundleUp.py
```
